  The Sonetel API is a powerful REST web-service that enables you to integrate your business processes with [Sonetel's SaaS Communication platform](https://developer.sonetel.com). It allows you to efficiently manage your account, users as well as phone number resources.

  The current version of the API supports the following.

  | `/account` | View & manage your Sonetel account details |
  | `/oauth/token` | Generate tokens that your applications can use to access the resources in your account.
  | `/calls` | Make callback calls using your Sonetel account.|
  | `/phonenumbersubscriptions` | Manage your existing phone numbers or purchase new ones. |
  | `/call-recording` | Manage your call recordings |
  | `/user` | Manage your user accounts, change their call settings and so on.|

  Sonetel offers separate sandbox and production environments to help you develop your application without affecting your production data.

  These environments can be accessed at the following URIs:

  ## How to find your account ID?

  You will need your account ID in order to access most resources linked to your account such as phone numbers and users.

  Issue a `GET` request to `https://beta-api.sonetel.com/account/` with your [access token](../reference/Authentication.yaml/post). The response object contains the basic details about your account including the account_id.

  ```json
  {
      "resource": "account",
